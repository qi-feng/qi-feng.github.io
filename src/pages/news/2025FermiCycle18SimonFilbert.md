Simon Filbert, a third-year graduate student in our group, led a NASA proposal to the Fermi Cycle 18 Guest Investigator program as the Science PI. 

This proposal was accepted by NASA and will support Simon's thesis work for a year with an award of about $80k. 

See the [list of the selected programs](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/proposals/cycle18/Cycle18ApprovedPrograms.pdf)
