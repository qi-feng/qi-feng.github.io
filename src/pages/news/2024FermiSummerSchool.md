    It is quite similar to early light buckets in 1952 that led to a Nature paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/171349a0"> W. GALBRAITH & J. V. JELLEY 
Nature volume 171, pages349â€“350 (1953)</a>.

    Of course, Jelly and Galbraith upgraded their light bucket by putting it in a trash can. It blocks stray light and reduces noise.
