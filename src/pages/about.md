I am an assistant professor in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Utah. 
My research interests are in high-energy gamma-ray and multi-messenger astrophysics, 
including the development of new astroparticle physics instrumentation and data analysis. 

My research group is primarily involved in the <a href="http://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/">VERITAS</a> 
and <a href="https://www.cta-observatory.org/">CTA</a> Collaborations and also work with data from 
ground-based and space telescopes across the electromagnetic spectrum, such as VLBA, Swift, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Fermi. 

Please find <a href="/CV.pdf">my CV here</a>.
